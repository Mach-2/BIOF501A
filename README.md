# Wastewater metagenome visualization with Kraken2

Write project notes here tomorrow. Sleepy for now. 

## 
• include the what’s and why’s – also your aims
• include any package dependencies that are required (bullet points are ok for this)
• You can include your DAG here

## Usage
Please upload all your code and necessary data required to run your pipeline into a Github
repository.
Make sure you format everything so that step-by-step usage details are included. If we can’t run your
pipeline, we can’t give you marks.
• Installation (if necessary) including any datasets that are to be used if they are not provided in
the Github (i.e. how to download them using wget or curl – exact paths need to be specified
and the data must be accessible)
• Exact step-by-step usage with descriptive comments on what action is being performed in
each step
• List required dependencies to run your pipeline.

## Input
Describe the format of the input data, explaining all fields.

## Output
Describe the format of the output including files and visualizations. Treat this section like the results of
a paper. You can look at readthedocs pages of popular bioinformatics tools to get inspired for this.
